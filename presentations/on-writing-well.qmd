## Clear writing requires clear thinking

* What am I trying to say?

  * Then: have I said it?

* What is the point you are trying to make?

WORDS

## Simplify

A sentence should contain no unnecessary words,

a paragraph no unnecessary sentences,

a section (or chapter) no unnecessary paragraphs

. . .

::::: {style="font-size: 0.7em;"}

* That doesn't mean make every sentence as short as possible:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth achieved his ambition and realized the prediction of the witches by murdering Duncan and becoming king of Scotland in his place.

:::: {.columns style="font-size:0.7em;"}
::: {.column width="15%"}

::: {.column width="40%"}
due to the fact that

## EDIT, EDIT, EDIT

* Rewriting is the essence of writing well

* Your first draft is probably not very good

* Read it out loud (or at least out loud inside your head)

  * Does it sound right?

* Always ask yourself:

  * Where have I lost the reader?
  
  * Where can I remove clutter?
  
  * Does each sentence follow logically from the last?
